## **3. Methodology**

3.1 Data Acquisition

A live video stream is captured using OpenCV’s VideoCapture(0), which accesses the system’s default webcam.

Each frame is resized to 480 × 360 pixels to reduce computational load and maintain smooth real-time performance.

This continuous stream serves as the input for all further processing steps.

3.2 Pre-processing

Pre-processing enhances the input frame before feature extraction and analysis.

a) Frame Resizing

The captured frame is resized to a fixed resolution to maintain consistency and ensure faster processing.


b) Color Space Conversion

The frame is converted from BGR to YCrCb color space.

YCrCb separates luminance (Y) from chrominance (Cr, Cb), making it more robust for skin detection under different lighting conditions.


c) Skin Segmentation

A binary mask is generated by applying a predefined YCrCb skin-color threshold range.

This isolates potential skin regions while suppressing the background.


d) Noise Removal

A Gaussian blur is applied to the mask to remove small noise patches and smooth the edges of the detected skin region.
